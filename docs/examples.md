# Examples

Ready-to-run examples demonstrating Guardrails in various scenarios. See the [`guardrails/examples/`](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/) folder for complete implementations.

## Example Implementations

- [hello_world.py](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/basic/hello_world.py) — Basic pipeline configuration with input/output guardrails
- [agents_sdk.py](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/basic/agents_sdk.py) — Integration with OpenAI Agents SDK
- [pii_mask_example.py](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/basic/pii_mask_example.py) — PII detection and scrubbing
- [structured_outputs_example.py](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/basic/structured_outputs_example.py) — Using responses.parse with guardrails
- [Streaming (fast)](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/implementation_code/fast) — Stream output while guardrails run
- [Blocking (slow)](https://github.com/OpenAI-Early-Access/guardrails/tree/main/guardrails/examples/implementation_code/slow) — Validate fully before showing output
